# ReinforcementLearningLab
Reinforcement Learning Lab for Computational Cognitive Psychology Course at Washington University
In this Lab, I coded and trained a reinforcement learning model to represent learning in volitile and stable environments using a psychological learning study dataset. I found the optimal learning rate with respect to changing reward probabilities and conditions and successfully represented the study's findings. I answered questions about my code and its corresponding reults to illustrate learning.
